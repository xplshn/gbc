# (gbc) | The Go B Compiler

This compiler is a project aiming to make a valid B compiler, with _optional_ syntax extensions, and a modules system like Go's

    Synopsis
        gbc <options> <input.b> ...

    Description
        A compiler for the B programming language with modern extensions. Like stepping into a time machine, but with better error messages.

    Options
        -C <arg>, --compiler-arg <arg>                 Pass a compiler-specific argument (e.g., -C linker_args='-s').
        -d, --dump-ir                                  Dump the intermediate representation and exit.
        -h, --help                                     Display this information
        -I <path>, --include <path>                    Add a directory to the include path.
        -L <arg>, --linker-arg <arg>                   Pass an argument to the linker.
        -o <file>, --output <file>                     Place the output into <file>.                                          |a.out|
        --pedantic                                     Issue all warnings demanded by the current B std.
        --std=std                                      Specify language standard (B, Bx)                                      |Bx|
        -t <backend/target>, --target <backend/target> Set the backend and target ABI.                                        |qbe|

### Progress Report:
- Capable of passing all tests
- Capable of compiling all examples. Producing the same output as the reference B compiler, against the same STDIN and argument inputs.
- Etc, these are just the most impressive examples
- I added a completely opt-in type system. It uses type first declarations like C, and uses the Go type names. (can also be used with strict B via `-std=B -Ftyped`, the syntax is backwards compatible. Its so reliable it comes enabled by default.)
- `gbc`'s warnings warn against common errors, poor decisions, etc
- Directives are supported
- Meta-programming: W.I.P
- Borrow-checking: Working on that!!! Will probably be the last feature of GBC once the most essential stuff is addressed
- Portable and with multiple backends:
  - QBE (default, via modernc.org/libQBE, a pure Go version of QBE)
  - LLVM (via `llc`)
  - TODO: GameBoy Color Target... Coming soon!!!

###### TODO: GIFs showcasing things properly

The project is currently in its infancy, and the long-term goals are very ambitious. This is the current roadmap:

> ##### ROADMAP
>
> ###### (i) Tests
> * ~~Make a script that takes the tests from [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b), and filters the tests.json to only include the IR tests~~
> * ~~Make a Go program that runs each test, displays the passing/failing ones~~
>
> ###### (ii) Compatibility with [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
> 1. ~~Support the "extrn" keyword, as well as inline assembly~~
> 2. ~~Use the same warning & error messages [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~ / our warnings n errors are much better
> 3. ~~Be able to pass the IR tests of [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~
> 4. A gameboy color target once _all_ examples can be compiled and work as expected (WIP)
>
> ###### (iii) Packages / Modules inspired by Go
> * Â¿.. Namespaces based on .mod file ..?
> * Implement a way to import/export symbols from different .B files, in different namespaces
>

### Contributions are hyper-mega welcome

###### Not B-related, but I did find these helpful for learning how to write the compiler:
- [comp-bib](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/): "Resources for Amateur Compiler Writers"
- [qcc](https://c9x.me/qcc): dead-simple C compiler
- [scc](https://www.simple-cc.org): The best C99 compiler out there. QBE-backed.
- [cproc](https://github.com/michaelforney/cproc): QBE-backed compiler written in C99, with support for some C23 & GNU C extensions

###### Cool stuff used by this project:
- [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/): The QBE compiler backend
- [modernc.org/libqbe](modernc.org/libqbe): A pure-go convertion of QBE, this allows `gbc` to be self-contained

###### TODO: ...I should write a Limbo compiler when I finish this project...
