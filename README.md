# (gbc) | The Go B Compiler

This compiler is a project aiming to make a valid B compiler, with _optional_ extensions for C interoperability, and a modules system like Go's

  Synopsis
    gbc [options] <input.b> ...

  Description
    A compiler for the B programming language and its extensions, written in Go.

  Options
    -o <file>              Place the output into <file>.
    -h, --help             Display this information.
    -std=<std>             Specify language standard (B, Bx). Default: Bx
    -pedantic              Issue all warnings demanded by the current B std.

  Warning Flags

    -Wno-<warning>         Disable a specific warning.
    Available warnings:
      c-escapes            Using C-style '\' escapes instead of B's '*'                                [x]

#### Progress Report:
- Capable of compiling donut.b
- Capable of compiling snake.b, but collisions for some reason do not work against the apple
- Capable of passing all tests
- Most examples work, but some fail to work as expected, with slight differences in behavior - I'm working on fixing this issue

The project is currently in its infancy, and the long-term goals are very ambitious. This is the current roadmap:

> ##### ROADMAP
>
> ###### (i) Tests
> * ~~Make a script that takes the tests from [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b), and filters the tests.json to only include the IR tests~~
> * Make a Go program that runs each test, displays the passing/failing ones
>
> ###### (ii) Compatibility with [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
> 1. ~~Support the "extrn" keyword, as well as inline assembly~~
> 2. ~~Use the same warning & error messages [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~ / our warnings n errors are much better
> 3. ~~Be able to pass the IR tests of [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~
>
> ###### (iii) Packages / Modules inspired by Go
> * Â¿.. Namespaces based on .mod file ..?
> * Implement a way to import/export symbols from different .B files, in different namespaces
>

### Contributions are hyper-mega welcome

###### Not B-related, but I did find these helpful for learning how to write the compiler:
- [comp-bib](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/): "Resources for Amateur Compiler Writers"
- [qcc](https://c9x.me/qcc): dead-simple C compiler
- [cproc](https://github.com/michaelforney/cproc): QBE-backed compiler written in C99, with support for some C23 & GNU C extensions

###### TODO: ...I should write a Limbo compiler when I finish this project...
