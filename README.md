### Progress Report:
- Capable of passing all tests
- Capable of compiling donut.b
- Capable of compiling snake.b
- Capable of compiling raylib.b (just remember to link with Raylib via `-L -lraylib`)
- Capable of compiling langtons_ants.b
- Capable of compiling brainfck.b
- Etc, these are just the most impressive examples
- I added a completely opt-in type system. It uses type first declarations like C, and uses the Go type names. (can also be used with strict B via `-std=B -Ftyped`, the syntax is backwards compatible. Its so reliable it comes enabled by default.)
- `gbc` will warn about poorly written code. TODO: Convert these warnings into annotations that offer suggestions.
- I'm working on adding support for alternative backends. QBE will remain as the default, but there should be other options as well, including a C one. (TODO: Expose GOABI0 target that libQBE provides)

###### TODO: GIFs showcasing things properly

The project is currently in its infancy, and the long-term goals are very ambitious. This is the current roadmap:

> ##### ROADMAP
>
> ###### (i) Tests
> * ~~Make a script that takes the tests from [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b), and filters the tests.json to only include the IR tests~~
> * ~~Make a Go program that runs each test, displays the passing/failing ones~~
>
> ###### (ii) Compatibility with [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)
> 1. ~~Support the "extrn" keyword, as well as inline assembly~~
> 2. ~~Use the same warning & error messages [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~ / our warnings n errors are much better
> 3. ~~Be able to pass the IR tests of [tsoding/b](https://github.com/tsoding/b)~~
> 4. A gameboy color target once _all_ examples can be compiled and work as expected
> 
> ###### (iii) Packages / Modules inspired by Go
> * Â¿.. Namespaces based on .mod file ..?
> * Implement a way to import/export symbols from different .B files, in different namespaces
>

### Contributions are hyper-mega welcome

###### Not B-related, but I did find these helpful for learning how to write the compiler:
- [comp-bib](https://c9x.me/compile/bib/): "Resources for Amateur Compiler Writers"
- [qcc](https://c9x.me/qcc): dead-simple C compiler
- [scc](https://www.simple-cc.org): The best C99 compiler out there. QBE-backed.
- [cproc](https://github.com/michaelforney/cproc): QBE-backed compiler written in C99, with support for some C23 & GNU C extensions

###### Cool stuff used by this project:
- [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/): The QBE compiler backend
- [modernc.org/libqbe](modernc.org/libqbe): A pure-go convertion of QBE, this allows `gbc` to be self-contained

###### TODO: ...I should write a Limbo compiler when I finish this project...
